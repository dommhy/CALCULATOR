## About this project

This is a calculator I made that can handle basic calculations, using the processing GUI library. There's not much to write about it, feel free to view the code.

## Project structure

### Running the program
- There is a `.jar` file stored as `Calculator.java`. You can run this if you have JVM installed
- For windows users, there is an `.exe` file that you can run.
- Unfortunately I don't have anything ready for mac users but maybe you can convert the `.jar` file to something that you can open

### Folder structure (code)
- Main code is stored under `src` as `Calculator.java`.
- Other classes are stored in other files in `src`.
- The project is created using the 'mvc' framework.
- Unit tests are stored within the same package as the class.

## How to use
You can input digits through text, or choose to use the buttons. Either way, it works.
Please let me know if you find any bugs within the program. Enjoy :)
