## About this project

This is a calculator I made from scratch that can handle basic calculations, using the processing GUI library. There's not much to write about it, feel free to view the code.

## Folder structure

- Main code is stored under `src` as `Calculator.java`.
- Other classes are stored in other files in `src`.
- The project is created using the 'mvc' framework.
- Unit tests are stored within the same package as the class.

## How to use
Run the file `Calculator.java`.
You can input through text, or choose to use the buttons. Either way, it works.
Please let me know if you find any bugs within the program.
